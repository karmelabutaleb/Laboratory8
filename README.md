IT-1025
This is my last and final lab for IT-1025. I enjoy working on the labs, but they are lengthy sometimes. However, I like the parts of Labs that we work on hands-on activities, like this part! I can't wait to complete all my required classes so that I can take technology classes!

I love pizza! I love pizza and cake! I am not fat, but curvy :)
